## Create branch

- **Before creating**: Check if there's an existing feature branch with `git branch -a`
- If working branch exists, switch to it with `git checkout <branch-name>`
- Only create new branch if no related work exists
- Branch names follow [Conventional Branch](https://conventional-branch.github.io/)
- feature/[FeatureName]-[implemented-feature-name]

Example: feature/admin-user-role-edit-invite-form
